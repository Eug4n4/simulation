# Simulation

## Description

This project is a turn-based simulation of a world inhabited by herbivores and predators. Herbivores's goal is to find grass. It serves as a food for them. Predators, on the other hand, are trying to reach herbivores and kill them.

The main goal of the project is to practice using main OOP principles: abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation.
